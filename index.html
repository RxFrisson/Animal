            <p class="textleftblack">The maned wolf is the largest canid of South America. Its
                markings resemble those of foxes, but it is neither a fox
                nor a wolf. It is the only species in the genus Chrysocyon
                (meaning “golden dog”).
                <br><br>
                This mammal is found in open and semiopen habitats,
                especially grasslands with scattered bushes and trees, in
                south, central-west, and southeastern Brazil, Paraguay,
                northern Argentina, and Bolivia east zand north of the
                Andes, and far southeastern Peru (Pampas del Heath only). It
                is very rare in Uruguay, possibly being displaced completely
                through loss of habitat.
                <br><br>The International Union for
                Conservation of Nature lists it as near threatened, while it
                is considered a vulnerable species by the Brazilian
                Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources.

            <p class="textleft">
                The maned wolf bears minor similarities to the red fox,
                although it belongs to a different genus. The average adult
                weighs 23 kg (51 lb) and stands 90 cm (35 in) tall at the
                shoulder, has a head-body length of 100 cm (39 in) with the
                tail adding another 45 cm (18 in).Its ears are large and
                long (7 inches).
                <br><br>
                The maned wolf is the tallest of the wild canids; its long
                legs are likely an adaptation to the tall grasslands of its
                native habitat.Fur of the maned wolf may be reddish-brown to
                golden orange on the sides with long, black legs, and a
                distinctive black mane. The coat is marked further with a
                whitish tuft at the tip of the tail and a white “bib”
                beneath the throat. The mane is erectile and typically is
                used to enlarge the wolf’s profile when threatened or when
                displaying aggression. Melanistic maned wolves do exist, but
                are rare.
                <br><br>
                The first photograph of a black adult maned wolf
                was taken by a camera trap in northern Minas Gerais in
                Brazil in 2013.
                The maned wolf also is known for the distinctive odor of its
                territory markings, which has earned it the nickname “skunk
                wolf”.

            <p class="textleftblack">
                Genetically, the maned wolf has 38 chromosomes, with a
                karyotype similar to that of other canids. Evidence suggests
                that 15,000 years ago, the species suffered a reduction in
                its genetic diversity, called the bottleneck effect.
                However, its diversity is still greater than that of other
                canids.
                <br><br>The skull can be identified by its reduced carnassials, small upper incisors and long canine teeth. Like other canids, it has 42 teeth.The skull also features a prominent sagittal crest.

                Both female and male maned wolves use their urine to
                communicate, e.g. to mark their hunting paths or the places
                where they have buried hunted prey.The urine has a very
                distinctive odor, which some people liken to hops or
                cannabis. The responsible substance very likely is a
                pyrazine, which also occurs in both plants. (At the
                Rotterdam Zoo, this smell once set the police on a hunt for
                cannabis smokers.The preferred habitat of the maned wolf
                includes grasslands, scrub prairies, and forests.
                <br><br>
                The most significant threat to Maned Wolf populations is the drastic reduction of habitat, especially due to conversion to agricultural land.In addition, habitat fragmentation causes isolation of subpopulations.
                <br>
                Many Maned Wolves are killed on the nation's roads. Highways border many of the Conservation Units of the Brazilian cerrado, and drivers often do not respect speed limits. Reserves close to urban areas often have problems with domestic dogs. These dogs pursue and may kill Maned Wolves and can also be an important source of disease.

                Unlike most wild canids (such as the gray wolf, the African
                hunting dog, or the dhole), the maned wolf is a solitary
                animal and does not form packs.It typically hunts alone,
                usually between sundown and midnight, rotating its large
                ears to listen for prey animals in the grass. They tap the
                ground with a front foot to flush out the prey and pounce to
                catch it. They kill prey by biting on the neck or back, and
                shaking the prey violently if necessary.
                <br><br>
                Monogamous pairs may defend a shared territory around 30 km2
                (12 sq mi), although outside of mating, the individuals may
                meet only rarely. The territory is crisscrossed by paths
                that they create as they patrol at night. Several adults may
                congregate in the presence of a plentiful food source, for
                example, a fire-cleared patch of grassland that would leave
                small vertebrate prey exposed while foraging.

                Although the maned wolf displays many fox-like
                characteristics, it is not closely related to foxes. It
                lacks the elliptical pupils found distinctively in foxes.
                The maned wolf’s evolutionary relationship to the other
                members of the canid family makes it a unique animal.
                Electrophoretic studies did not link Chrysocyon with any of
                the other living canids studied. One conclusion of this
                study is that the maned wolf is the only species among the
                large South American canids that survived the late
                Pleistocene extinction. Fossils of the maned wolf from the
                Holocene and the late Pleistocene have been excavated from
                the Brazilian Highlands.

                The maned wolf is not closely related to any other living
                canid. It is not a fox, wolf, coyote, dog, or jackal, but a
                distinct canid, though, based only on morphological
                similarities, it previously had been placed in the Canis and
                Vulpes genera.Its closest living relative is the bush dog
                (genus Speothos), and it has a more distant relationship to
                other South American canines (the short-eared dog, the
                crab-eating fox, and the zorros or Lycalopex).

                Generally, the maned wolf is shy and flees when alarmed, so
                it poses little direct threat to humans. Popularly, the
                maned wolf is thought to have the potential of being a
                chicken thief. It once was considered a similar threat to
                cattle and sheep, although this now is known to be false.
                <br><br>
                Historically, in a few parts of Brazil, these animals were
                hunted for some body parts, notably the eyes, that were
                believed to be good-luck charms. Since its classification as
                a vulnerable species by the Brazilian government, it has
                received greater consideration and protection.
                <br>
                They are threatened by habitat loss and being run over by
                automobiles. Feral and domestic dogs pass on diseases to
                them, and have been known to attack them.
                <br><br>
                The species occurs in several protected areas, including the
                national parks of Caraça and Emas in Brazil. The maned wolf
                is well represented in captivity and has been bred
                successfully at many zoos,particularly in Argentina, North
                America (part of a Species Survival Plan) and Europe (part
                of a European Endangered Species Programme). In 2012, a
                total of 3,288 maned wolves was kept at more than 300
                institutions worldwide. The Smithsonian National Zoo Park
                has been working to protect maned wolves for nearly 30
                years, and coordinates the collaborative, interzoo maned
                wolf Species Survival Plan of North America, which includes
                breeding maned wolves, studying them in the wild, protecting
                their habitat, and educating people about them.
